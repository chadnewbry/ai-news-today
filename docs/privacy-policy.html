    <p class="updated">Last updated: March 1, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>ai news today</strong> ("the App") is operated by Chad Newbry, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notification preferences:</strong> Your chosen daily digest time and notification settings are stored locally on your device using standard system storage (UserDefaults). This data never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>News content:</strong> The App fetches AI news articles from external sources. These network requests may include your device's IP address as part of standard internet communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking tools.</li>
        <li>We do not collect device identifiers for advertising purposes.</li>
        <li>We do not require account creation or login.</li>

    <p>All user preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not maintain servers that store your personal data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
